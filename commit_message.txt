feat(ui): Implement ZinLogo component with multiple variants

- Add ZinLogo component with support for different variants (full, icon, text)
- Implement multiple color schemes (primary, white on dark, dark on light, outline)
- Add animation support for the logo
- Temporarily use PNG files due to SVG rendering issues
- Document development decisions and future improvements

This implementation provides a consistent way to display the ZinApp logo
throughout the application with appropriate styling for different contexts.
SVG implementation will be improved in a future update.
