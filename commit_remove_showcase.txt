refactor: remove duplicate component showcase screen

# Conflict Resolution
- Remove duplicate component showcase screen in UI layer
- Remove separate main entry point for showcase
- Retain the ZinButton component for the new UI layer

This commit avoids potential conflicts with the existing component showcase in the features directory, while keeping the new ZinButton component as part of the three-layer architecture implementation.
