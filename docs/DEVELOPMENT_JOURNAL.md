*   **Entry:** Refactored the project structure to align with the documented file structure guidelines in `docs/V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md`.
*   **Entry:** Moved models from `lib/app/models` to `lib/models` directory.
*   **Entry:** Moved services from `lib/app/services` to `lib/services` directory.
*   **Entry:** Reorganized providers into feature-specific directories (auth, feed, profile, stylist).
*   **Entry:** Moved router.dart and error_screen.dart to the root lib directory.
*   **Entry:** Updated import paths throughout the codebase to reflect the new structure.
*   **Entry:** Fixed provider references in auth_wrapper.dart and other components.
*   **Decision:** Maintained the existing provider pattern while reorganizing the code structure.
*   **Decision:** Kept feature-specific models in their respective feature directories when they're only used within that feature.
*   **Challenge:** After refactoring, the app was stuck on the loading screen due to provider reference issues.
*   **Solution:** Systematically updated import paths in all affected files, particularly focusing on the auth components that were causing the loading issue.
*   **Next:** Begin migration from Provider to Riverpod for improved state management.

*   **Entry:** Created Architecture Decision Record (ADR-001) for migrating from Provider to Riverpod.
*   **Entry:** Created Riverpod migration tracking document to monitor progress.
*   **Decision:** Adopted a feature-by-feature migration approach to maintain a working application throughout the process.
*   **Decision:** Selected code generation approach with @riverpod annotations for better type safety and reduced boilerplate.
*   **Decision:** Established migration order: Auth → Profile → Feed → Stylist features.

*   **Entry:** Configured ProviderScope in main.dart to enable Riverpod.
*   **Entry:** Created Riverpod-based Auth provider with code generation.
*   **Entry:** Implemented Riverpod versions of login, registration, and auth wrapper components.
*   **Decision:** Created parallel implementations in separate directories to maintain compatibility during migration.
*   **Challenge:** Managing state consistently between Provider and Riverpod implementations during the transition.
*   **Solution:** Created separate component hierarchies that can coexist during the migration process.
*   **Next:** Integrate Riverpod-based auth components into the router and test the authentication flow.


## 2025-04-12

*   **Entry:** Implemented core authentication system with local JSON Server backend.
*   **Entry:** Created comprehensive user profile model with gamification elements (XP, level, tokens, achievements).
*   **Entry:** Implemented authentication service and provider for state management.
*   **Entry:** Created user profile service for managing gamification data.
*   **Entry:** Implemented basic split-screen home layout with three sections.
*   **Entry:** Updated router configuration with authentication protection.
*   **Decision:** Used Provider pattern for state management to simplify implementation.
*   **Decision:** Created AuthWrapper component to handle route protection based on authentication state.
*   **Decision:** Implemented a clean service layer architecture with clear separation of concerns.
*   **Challenge:** Managing complex user profile data with proper serialization.
*   **Solution:** Used json_serializable for automatic JSON serialization/deserialization.
*   **Next:** Setting up JSON Server for local testing, implementing the remaining UI components for the split-screen home layout, and enhancing the gamification features.

## 2025-04-11

*   **Entry:** Developed comprehensive implementation plan for ZinApp V2 with focus on split-screen home design, gamification elements, and token economy.
*   **Entry:** Created detailed phased approach with clear priorities: core app structure, split-screen home implementation, basic gamification, enhanced stylist discovery, and token economy.
*   **Entry:** Established local authentication strategy using JSON Server for MVP testing before cloud integration.
*   **Decision:** Adopted a documentation-first approach with emphasis on clean execution and surgical precision for all implementations.
*   **Decision:** Selected a local JSON server approach for authentication during MVP phase to accelerate development while simulating real backend behavior.
*   **Decision:** Designed a three-section home screen layout with HUD dashboard (top 20%), action/discovery zone (middle 30%), and social feed (bottom 50%).
*   **Decision:** Created comprehensive ZinToken economy design with earning mechanisms, spending options, and economic balancing.
*   **Challenge:** Balancing immediate implementation needs with long-term architecture goals for eventual cloud migration.
*   **Solution:** Designed service layer with clear interfaces that can be swapped between local and cloud implementations without affecting UI.
*   **Next:** Implementing local authentication system with JSON Server, extending user profile data model with gamification fields, and creating the basic split-screen home layout.

## 2025-04-10

*   **Entry:** Initial setup of the new Flutter project (`zinapp_v2`) completed after resolving Flutter SDK installation and PATH issues. Project initialized, base directory structure created, linter configured, `.gitignore` added.
*   **Entry:** Copied V2 specification documents (Architecture, Brand Identity, Components, etc.) from the old project structure into `zinapp_v2/docs/v2`.
*   **Entry:** Implemented the core V2 theme system (`ThemeData`, `ColorScheme`, `TextTheme`) in `lib/app/theme/`. Declared Urbanist font assets in `pubspec.yaml`. Applied the theme in `main.dart`.
*   **Decision:** Confirmed Flutter as the target platform for V2, adopting a rebuild strategy instead of porting from React Native. (Ref: `docs/v2/V2_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
*   **Decision:** Chose Riverpod as the primary state management solution. (Ref: `docs/v2/V2_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
*   **Decision:** Selected Urbanist as the primary font. (Ref: `docs/v2/V2_TYPOGRAPHY_SYSTEM.md`)
*   **Decision:** Adopted an `ApiService` abstraction for data handling. (Ref: `docs/v2/V2_DATA_HANDLING.md`)
*   **Challenge:** Encountered issues running `flutter create` via the execution tool due to environment/PATH problems. Required manual SDK installation verification and running `flutter create .` directly.
*   **Next:** Setting up the remaining living documentation files (Known Issues, Decisions, etc.). Planning the first implementation steps (API service abstraction, core widgets).
