## 2025-04-13: Sprint 1 Completion - Foundation & Mock Backend

**Author:** Development Team (via Cline)
**Status:** Complete

**Summary:**
Completed the first sprint focused on establishing a solid foundation for further development, addressing critical UI issues, and setting up a mock backend environment. This sprint prepares the project for implementing core features like the gamification engine.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **UI Overflow Fixes:**
    *   Applied `SafeArea` to `TokenShopScreen`.
    *   Wrapped expandable content in `AchievementsCard` and `ChallengesCard` with `SingleChildScrollView`.
    *   Improved image error placeholders in `TrendingStylesCard`.
    *   *(Commit: `a3c8d12`)*

2.  **Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   Confirmed standard `test/` directory structure and necessary dependencies (`flutter_test`, `mockito`).
    *   Created the first widget test for `ZinButton`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

3.  **Local Persistence:**
    *   Implemented `LocalStorageService` using `shared_preferences`.
    *   Added Riverpod providers for the service.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

4.  **Mock Backend (`json-server`):**
    *   Updated `data/db.json` with `challenges` definitions and user `streak` fields.
    *   Created `start_json_server.bat` for Windows compatibility.
    *   Successfully started `json-server` via `npx`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

5.  **Data Layer (Remote Data Sources):**
    *   Added `dio` dependency.
    *   Created interfaces and `dio`-based implementations for `UserRemoteDataSource`, `StylistRemoteDataSource`, `PostRemoteDataSource`, `CommentRemoteDataSource`, `BookingRemoteDataSource`, and `GamificationRemoteDataSource`.
    *   Configured data sources to connect to the running `json-server`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

6.  **Models:**
    *   Created `Badge` and `Challenge` models with `json_serializable` annotations.
    *   Ran `build_runner` to generate `.g.dart` files.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

7.  **Authentication Scaffolding:**
    *   Created basic `LoginScreen` UI.
    *   Implemented `AuthRepository` connecting `AuthProvider` to data sources and local storage.
    *   Updated `AuthProvider` to use the repository.
    *   Temporarily modified `AuthState` to use `User` instead of `UserProfile` to resolve immediate type errors (marked with TODOs for refactoring).
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*

**Challenges:**

*   Encountered multiple failures with `replace_in_file` when making sequential edits, requiring fallback to `write_to_file`.
*   Initial assumptions about model structures (`UserModel`, `Badge`, `Challenge`) were incorrect, requiring file inspection and creation/correction.
*   Identified a type mismatch between `User` (returned by `AuthRepository`) and `UserProfile` (expected by `AuthState`), necessitating a temporary workaround in `AuthState` and `AuthProvider`.

**Next Steps (Sprint 2):**

*   Focus on implementing the core Gamification Engine logic in the Simulation layer.
*   Expand test coverage (unit, integration) for repositories, services, and gamification logic.
*   Implement a robust error handling layer.
*   Refactor `AuthState` and related providers to correctly handle `UserProfile` fetching and state management.
*   Address remaining UI polish items from feedback.
