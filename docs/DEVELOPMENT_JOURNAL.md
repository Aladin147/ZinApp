## 2025-04-13: Sprint 2 - Phase 1: Gamification Simulation Logic

**Author:** Development Team (via Cline)
**Status:** In Progress

**Summary:**
Began Sprint 2 by implementing the initial structure and core logic for the gamification system within the simulation layer (`lib/sim/`). This phase focuses on defining the rules and state management for XP, levels, tokens, streaks, and achievements, independent of the data layer for now.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Gamification State:** Created `lib/sim/gamification/gamification_state.dart` to define the state managed by the simulation (XP, level, tokens, achievements, badges, streak info).
2.  **Gamification Simulation:**
    *   Created `lib/sim/gamification/gamification_simulation.dart` using Riverpod Generator (`@riverpod`).
    *   Implemented initial `build` method returning `GamificationState.initial()`.
    *   Implemented `processUserAction` method to calculate XP based on action type and handle level-ups (including awarding tokens).
    *   Implemented `addXp` and `addTokens` methods for direct state manipulation.
    *   Implemented `checkDailyStreak` method with basic logic for tracking and rewarding streaks.
    *   Implemented placeholder `unlockAchievement` method.
    *   Added TODOs for challenge progress logic and data layer integration.
3.  **Code Generation:** Ran `build_runner` to generate `gamification_simulation.g.dart`.

**Challenges:**

*   Ensured correct usage of the `state` property within the Riverpod Notifier class for state access and updates.

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement detailed logic for `_updateChallengeProgress`.
*   Refine level-up logic and potentially extract shared logic between `processUserAction` and `addXp`.
*   Implement logic for awarding XP/Tokens upon achievement unlock (requires fetching definitions).
*   Write unit tests for the implemented simulation logic.
*   Update `TODO.md`.

## 2025-04-13: Sprint 1 Completion - Foundation & Mock Backend

**Author:** Development Team (via Cline)
**Status:** Complete

**Summary:**
Completed the first sprint focused on establishing a solid foundation for further development, addressing critical UI issues, and setting up a mock backend environment. This sprint prepares the project for implementing core features like the gamification engine.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **UI Overflow Fixes:**
    *   Applied `SafeArea` to `TokenShopScreen`.
    *   Wrapped expandable content in `AchievementsCard` and `ChallengesCard` with `SingleChildScrollView`.
    *   Improved image error placeholders in `TrendingStylesCard`.
    *   *(Commit: `a3c8d12`)*
2.  **Build Error Fixes (User/UserProfile):**
    *   Reverted `AuthState` to correctly expect `UserProfile`.
    *   Created `UserProfileRemoteDataSource` and `UserProfileRepository`.
    *   Refactored `AuthProvider` to handle two-step auth flow (fetch User, then UserProfile).
    *   Updated UI components (`RiverpodTestScreen`, `DashboardHomeScreen`, `EnhancedHomeScreen`, `DashboardProfileScreen`, `ProfileEditScreen`, `GameProfileScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `TokenShopScreen`, `TokenShopCard`) to correctly access `UserProfile` data from `AuthState`.
    *   *(Commits: `6818437`, `0cb55d5`)*
3.  **Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   Confirmed standard `test/` directory structure and necessary dependencies (`flutter_test`, `mockito`).
    *   Created the first widget test for `ZinButton`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*
4.  **Local Persistence:**
    *   Implemented `LocalStorageService` using `shared_preferences`.
    *   Added Riverpod providers for the service.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*
5.  **Mock Backend (`json-server`):**
    *   Updated `data/db.json` with `challenges` definitions and user `streak` fields.
    *   Created `start_json_server.bat` for Windows compatibility.
    *   Successfully started `json-server` via `npx`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*
6.  **Data Layer (Remote Data Sources):**
    *   Added `dio` dependency.
    *   Created interfaces and `dio`-based implementations for User, Stylist, Post, Comment, Booking, and Gamification entities connecting to `json-server`.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*
7.  **Models:**
    *   Created `Badge` and `Challenge` models with `json_serializable` annotations.
    *   Ran `build_runner` to generate `.g.dart` files.
    *   *(Commit: `b7f6ee6`)*
8.  **Authentication Scaffolding:**
    *   Created basic `LoginScreen` UI.
    *   Implemented `AuthRepository` connecting `AuthProvider` to data sources and local storage.
    *   Updated `AuthProvider` to use the repository.
    *   Implemented user creation in mock backend via `AuthRepository.register`.
    *   *(Commits: `b7f6ee6`, `4c2eaf2`)*
9.  **Code Generation:** Ran `build_runner` multiple times to generate necessary files after model/provider updates. *(Commits: `b7f6ee6`, `6818437`)*
10. **Documentation:** Updated `TODO.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`. *(Commit: `a8a2c8b`)*


**Challenges:**

*   Encountered multiple failures with `replace_in_file` when making sequential edits, requiring fallback to `write_to_file`.
*   Initial assumptions about model structures (`UserModel`, `Badge`, `Challenge`) were incorrect, requiring file inspection and creation/correction.
*   Build errors caused by `User`/`UserProfile` type mismatch required significant refactoring across `AuthState`, `AuthProvider`, and UI components.
*   `json-server` startup issues on Windows required switching from `.bat` script to `npx`.
*   Registration flow initially failed due to user record not being created in the mock backend; fixed by implementing `createUser` in the data source and repository.
