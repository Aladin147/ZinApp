# ZinApp V2 Progress Journal

This document tracks the progress, decisions, and challenges encountered during the development of ZinApp V2.

## April 13, 2025: Stylist Discovery and Feed Implementation

### Goals
- Set up JSON Server for local testing
- Implement stylist discovery in the action zone
- Create social feed components
- Enhance the split-screen home layout

### Accomplishments
- Set up JSON Server with comprehensive mock data
- Created scripts for starting JSON Server on different platforms

- Phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value

### Decisions
- Adopt documentation-first approach with clean execution and surgical precision
- Use local JSON server for authentication during MVP phase
- Design three-section home layout with specific proportions
- Implement comprehensive gamification system from the start

### Challenges
- Balancing immediate implementation needs with long-term architecture
- Creating a local authentication system that can be easily migrated to cloud
- Designing an engaging yet meaningful gamification system

### Next Steps
- Set up JSON Server for local authentication
- Implement AuthService with basic functionality
- Extend user profile model with gamification fields
- Create basic structure for split-screen home layout

## April 9, 2025: V2 Kickoff

### Goals
- Set up V2-Dev branch
- Create initial documentation structure
- Analyze V2 memo and requirements

### Accomplishments
- Created V2-Dev branch from master
- Set up basic documentation structure
- Received and analyzed V2 memo
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md
  - V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md
  - V2_GAMIFICATION.md
  - V2_COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md
  - V2_PROGRESS_JOURNAL.md

### Key Insights from V2 Memo
- ZinApp is transitioning from an MVP to a flagship product
- Visual quality, polish, structure, and brand alignment need significant improvement
- New brand identity with specific color palette and typography
- Addition of gamification elements (XP, levels, tokens)
- More dynamic, layered UI with depth and visual feedback
- Structured file organization and component architecture

### Decisions
- Maintain V1 codebase in master branch as reference
- Create new V2-Dev branch for all V2 development
- Document all aspects of V2 before beginning implementation
- Follow strict file structure and naming conventions
- Implement design token system for consistent styling

### Next Steps
- Set up project structure according to V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md
- Create design token system based on V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md
- Implement foundation components following V2_COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md
- Set up placeholder gamification system as outlined in V2_GAMIFICATION.md

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing V1 Logic Reuse with V2 Visual Redesign
**Solution:** Create adapter patterns to bridge V1 logic with V2 UI components, allowing gradual migration.

### Challenge: Implementing Gamification Without Backend
**Solution:** Create a robust mock system with local storage that simulates the full gamification experience.

### Challenge: Ensuring Consistent Visual Language
**Solution:** Implement a strict design token system and component library with thorough documentation.

## Technical Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Apr 9, 2025 | Create V2-Dev branch | Clean separation from V1 | Feature branches, parallel repo |
| Apr 9, 2025 | Document-first approach | Ensure alignment before coding | Code-first with documentation after |
| Apr 9, 2025 | Design token system | Consistent styling across app | Direct styling, CSS-in-JS |

## Open Questions

1. **Font Selection**: Which specific sans-serif font should we use? Urbanist, Nunito, or Inter?
2. **Animation Library**: Should we use React Native Animated, Reanimated, or Lottie for different animation needs?
3. **Gamification Backend**: How will the gamification system integrate with the backend in the future?
4. **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should we use for V2 components and screens?
