## 2024-04-11: Enhanced Splash Screen Animations

### Work Completed
- Enhanced the splash screen animations for a more polished user experience
- Created comprehensive animation guidelines document
- Added detailed component documentation for the splash screen

### Technical Decisions
- Used a sequence of animations for a more natural feel:
  - Initial fade-in and scale-up with a slight bounce
  - Delayed fade-in for the tagline text
  - Subtle continuous pulse animation after the initial animation completes
- Implemented using Flutter's built-in animation system without additional dependencies
- Used `TickerProviderStateMixin` to support multiple animation controllers
- Created a `Listenable.merge` to efficiently combine animations

### Animation Details
- Main animation duration increased to 1500ms for a smoother feel
- Added a slight bounce effect (scale to 1.02 then back to 1.0)
- Implemented staggered timing for tagline appearance
- Added subtle continuous pulse (1.0 to 1.03) with 2000ms duration

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding background elements or patterns
- Implement a loading indicator for actual loading states
- Add support for custom taglines
- Explore more complex logo animations

## 2024-04-11: UI Enhancement Plan Based on Collaborator Feedback

### Feedback Analysis
- Received detailed feedback from collaborators on the current UI implementation
- Analyzed suggestions based on priority and alignment with project goals
- Created a prioritized implementation plan focusing on high-impact improvements

### Key Focus Areas
1. **High Priority**:
   - Fix SVG rendering issues for logo and icon assets
   - Improve typography on light backgrounds
   - Add basic animations to splash screen

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Add motion to interactive elements (cards, buttons)
   - Create a simple mock feed
   - Ensure responsive layouts

3. **Low Priority** (for later implementation):
   - Streamline logo variants
   - Add badge usage examples in context
   - Enhance CTA buttons with subtle animations

### Technical Approach
- Use Flutter's built-in animation system for initial implementations
- Optimize SVG files to work with flutter_svg
- Implement responsive layouts using MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder
- Document all enhancements with usage guidelines and examples

### Next Steps
- Begin implementing high-priority items
- Create detailed documentation for each enhancement
- Update development journal with progress and decisions

## 2024-04-11: Logo Implementation and SVG Handling

### Work Completed
- Implemented the `ZinLogo` component with support for different variants:
  - Full Logo
  - Icon Only
  - Text Only
  - White on Dark
  - Outline
  - Animated
- Initially attempted to use SVG files for better scalability
- Encountered issues with Flutter's SVG renderer not supporting certain SVG elements like `<style>` and `<filter>`
- Temporarily switched to PNG implementation for reliable rendering
- Successfully implemented all logo variants with appropriate styling

### Technical Decisions
- Used PNG files as a temporary solution due to SVG rendering issues
- Created a flexible component that can be used throughout the app
- Implemented different color schemes and variants to match design requirements
- Added animation support for the logo

### Future Improvements
- Simplify SVG files to remove unsupported elements
- Test with a more basic SVG structure that Flutter can render properly
- Consider using a more robust SVG rendering package if needed
- Implement proper color handling for SVG files

### Notes
- The current PNG implementation works well but lacks the scalability of SVG
- SVG implementation will be important for the animated splash screen
- Need to ensure consistent appearance across all platforms
