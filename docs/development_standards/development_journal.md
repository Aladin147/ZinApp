## 2024-04-11: Logo Implementation and SVG Handling

### Work Completed
- Implemented the `ZinLogo` component with support for different variants:
  - Full Logo
  - Icon Only
  - Text Only
  - White on Dark
  - Outline
  - Animated
- Initially attempted to use SVG files for better scalability
- Encountered issues with Flutter's SVG renderer not supporting certain SVG elements like `<style>` and `<filter>`
- Temporarily switched to PNG implementation for reliable rendering
- Successfully implemented all logo variants with appropriate styling

### Technical Decisions
- Used PNG files as a temporary solution due to SVG rendering issues
- Created a flexible component that can be used throughout the app
- Implemented different color schemes and variants to match design requirements
- Added animation support for the logo

### Future Improvements
- Simplify SVG files to remove unsupported elements
- Test with a more basic SVG structure that Flutter can render properly
- Consider using a more robust SVG rendering package if needed
- Implement proper color handling for SVG files

### Notes
- The current PNG implementation works well but lacks the scalability of SVG
- SVG implementation will be important for the animated splash screen
- Need to ensure consistent appearance across all platforms
