# ZinApp UI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to transform ZinApp's current functional UI into a polished, joyful, investor-grade mobile experience that reflects brand identity, clarity, trust, and premium value.

## Current Status Assessment

### What's Working
- Basic component structure is in place (Button, Card, Typography, Screen, Header)
- Design tokens are defined in constants (colors, spacing, typography)
- Logo component with variants is implemented
- Some animations are implemented (button press, card fade-in)
- Basic layout structure with proper spacing

### What Needs Improvement
- Typography is using Inter font instead of Uber Move
- Inconsistent use of design tokens across components
- Many screens still use basic styling without proper visual polish
- Animation system is not fully implemented
- Visual identity is not consistently applied

- [x] Create `constants/typography.ts` with the typography system
- [x] Create `constants/spacing.ts` with the spacing scale
- [x] Create `constants/animations.ts` with animation constants
- [ ] Update DESIGN_TOKENS.md to match implementation
- [ ] Create a global style guide component for reference

### Configure twrnc
- [x] Set up twrnc for utility-first styling
