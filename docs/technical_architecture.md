# ZinApp Technical Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for ZinApp, detailing the structure, patterns, and technologies used in the application.

## Architecture Pattern
ZinApp follows a layered architecture based on Clean Architecture principles, with clear separation of concerns:

### Layers
1. **Presentation Layer**
   - UI components (screens, widgets)
   - State management
   - Navigation

2. **Domain Layer**
   - Business logic
   - Entity models
   - Use cases

3. **Data Layer**
   - Repositories
   - Data sources (remote, local)
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

## Directory Structure

```

## State Management
ZinApp uses a combination of state management approaches:

1. **Provider/Riverpod**
   - For app-wide state management
   - For dependency injection

2. **ChangeNotifier/StateNotifier**
   - For complex widget state
   - For feature-specific state

3. **StatefulWidget**
   - For simple, localized UI state

## Data Flow
1. **UI Layer**
   - Displays data to the user
   - Captures user input
   - Delegates to controllers/providers

2. **Controllers/Providers**
   - Process UI events
   - Coordinate between UI and business logic
   - Update UI state

3. **Use Cases**
   - Implement business rules
   - Orchestrate data operations
   - Return results to controllers

4. **Repositories**
   - Abstract data sources
   - Handle data operations
   - Convert between DTOs and domain models

5. **Data Sources**
   - Communicate with external systems (API, database)
   - Cache data locally
   - Handle data serialization/deserialization

## Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials
2. AuthService validates credentials with Firebase Auth
3. On success, user token is stored securely
4. User profile is fetched from Firestore
5. User is redirected to the appropriate screen based on user type

## Navigation
- **GoRouter** for declarative routing
- Route guards for authentication checks
- Deep linking support
- Custom page transitions

## API Communication
- **Dio/http** package for HTTP requests
- Repository pattern to abstract API calls
- Error handling and retry logic
- Response caching

## Local Storage
- **SharedPreferences** for simple key-value storage
- **Hive** for complex object storage
- **SQLite** for relational data (if needed)

## Asset Management
- Images stored in assets directory
- SVG support for vector graphics
- Font assets for custom typography
- Asset generation for app icons

## Error Handling
- Global error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Error logging and reporting
- Graceful degradation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests** for business logic and repositories
- **Widget Tests** for UI components
- **Integration Tests** for feature flows
- **Golden Tests** for UI appearance

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of tokens
- Input validation
- HTTPS for all network requests
- Obfuscation of production code
- Regular security audits

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of resources
- Image caching and optimization
- Minimizing rebuilds
- Memory management

## Accessibility
- Semantic labels for screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast
- Scalable text
- Support for system accessibility settings

## Internationalization
- Support for multiple languages
- Locale-aware formatting
- RTL layout support
- Cultural adaptations

## Deployment Pipeline
1. Code review
2. Automated testing
3. Build generation
4. Beta distribution
5. Production release

This architecture is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable as the application grows in complexity.
