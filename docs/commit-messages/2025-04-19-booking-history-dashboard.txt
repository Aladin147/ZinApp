feat(ui): Implement dashboard UI for Booking History

This commit implements a dashboard-style UI for the Booking History screen, 
following the same approach used for the Home Screen, Rewards Hub, and Stylist 
Discovery screens. The implementation enhances the visual presentation and user 
experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

Key changes:
- Created BookingProvider and BookingService for managing booking data
- Implemented specialized expandable cards:
  - PastBookingsCard: Shows past appointments
  - FavoriteStylesCard: Shows favorite styles based on booking history
  - RebookCard: Shows quick rebook options for favorite stylists
- Added navigation from BookingConfirmationScreen and HomeDashboard to the Booking History screen
- Updated app routes and router to include the booking history screen
- Added documentation in journal and REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md

This implementation is part of our effort to create a more immersive,
game-like experience throughout the app, with a consistent design language
and interactive elements.
