feat(ui): Implement dashboard UI for Stylist Discovery

This commit implements a dashboard-style UI for the Stylist Discovery screen, 
following the same approach used for the Home Screen and Rewards Hub. The 
implementation enhances the visual presentation and user experience while 
maintaining all existing functionality.

Key changes:
- Created StylistDiscoveryDashboard widget as the main container
- Implemented specialized expandable cards:
  - FeaturedStylistsCard: Shows featured stylists
  - RecommendedStylistsCard: Shows personalized stylist recommendations
  - StyleCategoriesCard: Shows style categories for browsing
  - NearbyStylesCard: Shows popular styles in the user's area
- Enhanced the StylistCard widget to support a compact mode
- Updated StylistDiscoveryScreen to use the new dashboard approach
- Added documentation in journal and REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md

This implementation is part of our effort to create a more immersive,
game-like experience throughout the app, with a consistent design language
and interactive elements.
