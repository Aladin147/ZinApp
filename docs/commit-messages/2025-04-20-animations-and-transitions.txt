feat(ui): Implement animations and custom page transitions

This commit implements a comprehensive animation system and custom page 
transitions to enhance the immersive, game-like experience of the app.

Key changes:
- Created a modular animation system:
  - AppAnimations: Standardized durations and curves
  - AnimationBuilders: Reusable animation patterns
  - Specialized animation widgets (PressableAnimationWidget, PulseAnimationWidget, etc.)
- Implemented custom page transitions:
  - Basic transitions (fade, slide, scale)
  - Combined transitions (fade+slide, fade+scale)
  - Game-like transitions (portal, deal card)
- Integrated with the router system:
  - Created CustomPageRoute for direct navigation
  - Added CustomGoRouter for GoRouter integration
  - Applied different transition types to different routes

This implementation addresses the "Missing Page Transitions" known issue
and enhances the overall user experience with subtle micro-animations and
dramatic page transitions that make the app feel more responsive and engaging.
