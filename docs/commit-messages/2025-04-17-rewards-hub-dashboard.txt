feat(ui): Implement dashboard UI for Rewards Hub

This commit implements a dashboard-style UI for the Rewards Hub screen, 
following the same approach used for the Home Screen. The implementation
enhances the visual presentation and user experience while maintaining
all existing functionality.

Key changes:
- Created RewardsDashboard widget as the main container
- Implemented specialized expandable cards:
  - DailyRewardsCard: Shows daily rewards and streak information
  - ChallengesCard: Shows active challenges
  - TokenShopCard: Shows featured items from the token shop
  - AchievementsCard: Shows user achievements
- Updated RewardsHubScreen to use the new dashboard approach
- Added documentation in journal and REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md

This implementation is part of our effort to create a more immersive,
game-like experience throughout the app, with a consistent design language
and interactive elements.
