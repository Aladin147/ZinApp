# ZinApp V2 Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the ZinApp V2 codebase to align with the documented file structure guidelines in `docs/V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md`.

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 2025-04-13

1. **Directory Structure Reorganization**
   - ✅ Moved models from `lib/app/models` to `lib/models`
   - ✅ Moved services from `lib/app/services` to `lib/services`
   - ✅ Moved theme files from `lib/app/theme` to `lib/theme`
   - ✅ Moved router.dart from `lib/app/router.dart` to `lib/router.dart`
   - ✅ Moved error_screen.dart from `lib/app/error_screen.dart` to `lib/error_screen.dart`

2. **Provider Reorganization**
   - ✅ Created feature-specific provider directories:
     - `lib/features/auth/providers`
     - `lib/features/feed/providers`
     - `lib/features/profile/providers`
     - `lib/features/stylist/providers`
   - ✅ Moved providers to their respective feature directories
   - ✅ Updated import paths in all affected files

3. **Import Path Updates**
   - ✅ Updated import paths in auth_wrapper.dart
   - ✅ Updated import paths in login_screen.dart and register_screen.dart
   - ✅ Updated import paths in enhanced_home_screen.dart
   - ✅ Updated import paths in action_hub_section.dart and gamer_dashboard_section.dart
   - ✅ Updated import paths in stylist_card.dart and post_card.dart
   - ✅ Updated import paths in main.dart

## Pending Refactoring Tasks

1. **Model Reorganization**
   - ⬜ Resolve model duplication between `lib/models/post.dart` and `lib/features/feed/models/post.dart`
   - ⬜ Standardize model interfaces across the application

2. **Service Improvements**
   - ⬜ Implement proper service interfaces according to the architecture guidelines
   - ⬜ Add proper error handling and logging to services

3. **UI Component Refactoring**
   - ⬜ Move common widgets to `lib/widgets` directory
   - ⬜ Standardize widget parameters and callbacks

4. **State Management**
   - ⬜ Prepare for migration from Provider to Riverpod
   - ⬜ Document state management patterns for future development

5. **Code Quality**
   - ⬜ Address deprecated method warnings (e.g., replace `withOpacity()` with `withValues()`)
   - ⬜ Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - ⬜ Add proper documentation to all public APIs

## Known Issues

1. **Post Model Inconsistency**
   - There are two different Post model implementations:
     - `lib/models/post.dart`: More comprehensive model with many fields
     - `lib/features/feed/models/post.dart`: Simpler model used by the feed feature
   - Need to standardize on a single model or create proper inheritance/composition

2. **Provider References**
   - Some components may still reference old provider paths
   - Need comprehensive testing to ensure all provider references are updated

3. **Theme References**
   - Some components may still reference old theme paths
   - Need to verify all theme imports are updated
