## Pending Refactoring Tasks

1. **Model Reorganization**
   - ⬜ Resolve model duplication between `lib/models/post.dart` and `lib/features/feed/models/post.dart`
   - ⬜ Standardize model interfaces across the application

2. **Service Improvements**
   - ⬜ Implement proper service interfaces according to the architecture guidelines
   - ⬜ Add proper error handling and logging to services

3. **UI Component Refactoring**
   - ⬜ Move common widgets to `lib/widgets` directory
   - ⬜ Standardize widget parameters and callbacks

4. **State Management**
   - ⬜ Prepare for migration from Provider to Riverpod
   - ⬜ Document state management patterns for future development

5. **Code Quality**
   - ⬜ Address deprecated method warnings (e.g., replace `withOpacity()` with `withValues()`)
   - ⬜ Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - ⬜ Add proper documentation to all public APIs

## Known Issues

1. **Post Model Inconsistency**
   - There are two different Post model implementations:
     - `lib/models/post.dart`: More comprehensive model with many fields
     - `lib/features/feed/models/post.dart`: Simpler model used by the feed feature
   - Need to standardize on a single model or create proper inheritance/composition

2. **Provider References**
   - Some components may still reference old provider paths
   - Need comprehensive testing to ensure all provider references are updated

3. **Deprecated Method Warnings**
   - Several components use deprecated methods:
     - `withOpacity()` should be replaced with `withValues()`
     - `MaterialStateProperty` should be replaced with `WidgetStateProperty`
     - `surfaceVariant` should be replaced with `surfaceContainerHighest`
   - These should be addressed in a future update

4. **Missing Page Transitions**
   - Custom page transitions were removed during refactoring
   - Need to implement new page transitions in the theme system

5. **Rewards Hub Integration**
   - The new dashboard-style Rewards Hub needs to be fully integrated with the backend
   - Need to implement proper data fetching and state management for rewards features

6. **Achievement System**
   - The achievement system needs to be fully implemented
   - Need to create a comprehensive achievement tracking system
