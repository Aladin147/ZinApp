# Technical Debt Resolution - Phase 1: Critical Error Resolution

**Date:** April 21, 2025  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Branch:** full-riverpod-migration  

## Overview

Today I began implementing Phase 1 of our Technical Debt Resolution Plan, focusing on fixing critical errors that were preventing the app from compiling. I addressed broken imports, undefined identifiers, and duplicate files.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Broken Imports

- Updated import paths in `lib/app/error_screen.dart` to reference the correct location of color_scheme.dart
- Moved error_screen.dart to the correct location in the directory structure

### 2. Fixed Model References

- Created a new auth_state.dart file in the correct location (`lib/features/auth/models/auth_state.dart`)
- Updated it to use the correct UserProfile model from `lib/models/user_profile.dart`

### 3. Fixed Service References

- Created a new auth_service_impl.dart file in the correct location (`lib/features/auth/services/auth_service_impl.dart`)
- Updated it to implement the AuthService interface and use the correct models and services

### 4. Removed Duplicate Files

- Removed duplicate files that were causing conflicts:
  - `lib/app/error_screen.dart`
  - `lib/app/services/auth_service.dart`
  - `lib/app/models/auth_state.dart`
  - `lib/app/services/user_profile_service.dart`
  - `lib/app/models/token_transaction.dart`

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Multiple Versions of Models
- **Problem**: There were multiple versions of the same models (User, UserProfile, etc.) in different locations.
- **Solution**: Identified the canonical versions in the `lib/models` directory and updated references to use these versions.

### Challenge: Broken Import Paths
- **Problem**: Many files referenced paths that no longer existed or had moved.
- **Solution**: Updated import paths to reference the correct locations based on the new directory structure.

### Challenge: Undefined Identifiers
- **Problem**: References to classes and variables that didn't exist or weren't properly imported.
- **Solution**: Added proper imports and fixed references to use the correct identifiers.

## Next Steps

1. Continue fixing remaining critical errors:
   - Address remaining undefined identifiers
   - Fix invalid constant usage
   - Ensure all imports resolve correctly

2. Run Flutter analyze again to verify that all critical errors have been resolved.

3. Move on to Phase 2: Directory Structure Cleanup once all critical errors are fixed.

## Technical Notes

- The app is using a mix of Provider and Riverpod for state management, which is causing some inconsistency.
- The auth system has two different implementations: one using a simple service and another using a more comprehensive interface.
- We need to standardize on a single approach for state management and authentication.
