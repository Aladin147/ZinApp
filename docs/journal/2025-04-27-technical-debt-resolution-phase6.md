# Technical Debt Resolution - Phase 6: Performance Optimization

**Date:** April 27, 2025  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Branch:** full-riverpod-migration  

## Overview

Today I completed Phase 6 of our Technical Debt Resolution Plan, focusing on performance optimization. I implemented image caching, lazy loading for lists, and optimized data loading patterns to improve the application's performance and user experience.

## Work Completed

### 1. Image Loading and Caching

- Created a utility class `ImageUtils` for image loading and caching
- Implemented `CachedNetworkImage` for all network images
- Added proper placeholder and error handling
- Optimized image loading with proper sizing and memory management

### 2. List and Grid Virtualization

- Implemented lazy loading for the feed screen
- Added pagination support to the feed service
- Updated the feed provider to support pagination
- Added scroll listeners to load more data when needed

### 3. Data Loading Optimization

- Implemented proper caching for API responses
- Added pagination for data fetching
- Optimized state management to reduce unnecessary rebuilds

## Results

- **Image Loading**: Images now load faster and are cached for better performance
- **List Performance**: Long lists now load incrementally, improving performance and reducing memory usage
- **Data Loading**: Data is now loaded more efficiently, with proper caching and pagination

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Image Caching
- **Problem**: The application was loading images directly with `Image.network`, which doesn't provide caching or proper error handling.
- **Solution**: Created a utility class `ImageUtils` that uses `CachedNetworkImage` to load and cache images, with proper error handling and placeholders.

### Challenge: List Performance
- **Problem**: Long lists were loading all items at once, which could lead to performance issues and poor user experience.
- **Solution**: Implemented pagination and lazy loading for lists, loading more items as the user scrolls.

### Challenge: Data Loading
- **Problem**: Data was being loaded inefficiently, with no caching or pagination.
- **Solution**: Updated the data loading logic to support pagination and caching, reducing the amount of data loaded at once and improving performance.

## Next Steps

1. Move on to Phase 7: Final Cleanup and Review
   - Perform a final code review
   - Address any remaining issues
   - Update documentation as needed

## Technical Notes

- The `ImageUtils` class provides a consistent way to load and cache images throughout the application.
- The feed screen now uses pagination to load posts incrementally, improving performance for long lists.
- The feed service now supports pagination, allowing for more efficient data loading.
- The feed provider now manages the pagination state, including the current page and whether there are more pages to load.
