# Development Journal: July 2, 2023

## Overview
Today we implemented the stylist discovery flow, which is a core user journey that allows users to find and connect with stylists. We also created a basic booking process to enable users to schedule appointments with stylists.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Stylist Discovery Flow
- **Navigation**: Implemented navigation from the home screen to the stylist discovery screen
- **Stylist Cards**: Fixed overflow issues in the StylistCard component
- **Stylist Profile**: Enhanced the StylistProfileScreen with proper navigation
- **Riverpod Integration**: Fixed provider modification issues during widget lifecycle

### 2. Booking Process
- **Booking Screen**: Created a new BookingScreen with date, time, and service selection
- **Booking Confirmation**: Implemented a BookingConfirmationScreen with success message and booking details
- **Navigation**: Connected all screens with proper navigation flow

### 3. UI Fixes
- Fixed overflow issues in multiple components
- Added SingleChildScrollView to prevent layout issues
- Fixed FloatingActionButton hero tag conflicts
- Adjusted component heights and padding for better display

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Riverpod Provider Modification Error
We encountered an error when trying to modify a provider during widget lifecycle:
```
Error: Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building.
```

**Solution**: Used `Future.microtask()` to delay provider modifications until after the widget tree is built. This ensures that provider state changes don't interfere with the widget lifecycle.

### Challenge 2: UI Overflow Issues
Several components had overflow issues, particularly in the StylistCard and BookingConfirmationScreen.

**Solution**: 
1. Added SingleChildScrollView to scrollable containers
2. Adjusted component heights and padding
3. Used mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min for better layout control

### Challenge 3: FloatingActionButton Hero Tag Conflicts
Multiple FloatingActionButtons with the same default hero tag caused conflicts.

**Solution**: Added unique hero tags to each FloatingActionButton to prevent animation conflicts.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Separate Booking Flow
We decided to implement a separate booking flow rather than integrating it directly into the stylist profile screen.

**Rationale**: This approach provides a cleaner user experience and allows for more flexibility in the booking process. It also makes it easier to reuse the booking flow in other contexts.

### Decision 2: Using Future.microtask for Provider Modifications
We used Future.microtask to delay provider modifications until after the widget tree is built.

**Rationale**: This approach prevents errors when modifying providers during widget lifecycle, ensuring a more stable application.

## Next Steps
- Implement search functionality in the stylist discovery screen
- Add filtering options for stylists (by service, availability, rating, etc.)
- Enhance the booking process with real-time availability checking
- Implement booking history and management
- Add token economy integration for booking rewards

## Notes and Observations
- The navigation flow is now much smoother
- The UI is more responsive and handles different screen sizes better
- We should consider adding more detailed stylist information in the profile screen
- The booking process needs integration with a backend service for real functionality
