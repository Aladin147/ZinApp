# Social Feed Like System Implementation - May 18, 2023

## Overview

Today I implemented the like system for the social feed, which is the first step in enhancing the social interactions in ZinApp. The like system allows users to like and unlike posts, with visual feedback and state persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Post Model Enhancement

I updated the Post model to include an `isLiked` field that tracks whether the current user has liked a post:

- Added `isLiked` field to the Post class
- Updated the `copyWith` method to include the new field
- Added the field to the props list for proper equality comparison

This change allows us to track and display the liked state of posts for the current user.

### 2. Feed Service Enhancement

I enhanced the FeedService to support toggling likes:

- Implemented a `toggleLike` method that handles both liking and unliking posts
- Added support for optimistic updates to provide immediate feedback
- Implemented proper error handling and recovery

The service now handles the API interaction for liking and unliking posts, with proper mock data support for development.

### 3. Feed Provider Enhancement

I updated the FeedProvider to manage like state:

- Implemented a `toggleLike` method that updates the local state and calls the service
- Updated the existing `likePost` method to use the new toggle functionality
- Added optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Implemented error handling with state recovery

The provider now manages the like state for posts and provides a clean interface for the UI to interact with.

### 4. Post Card Enhancement

I enhanced the PostCard widget to display and handle likes:

- Updated the engagement stats to show the liked state with different icons and colors
- Implemented tap handling for likes that calls the provider
- Added visual feedback for the liked state

The UI now properly displays whether a post is liked and allows users to toggle the like state with visual feedback.

## Technical Details

### Optimistic Updates

I implemented optimistic updates for likes to provide immediate feedback to the user:

```dart
// Create a new list with the updated post
final updatedPosts = List<Post>.from(state.posts);
updatedPosts[postIndex] = post.copyWith(
  isLiked: !isCurrentlyLiked,
  likesCount: isCurrentlyLiked ? post.likesCount - 1 : post.likesCount + 1,
);

// Update state optimistically
state = state.copyWith(posts: updatedPosts);

// Call the API to update the like status
await ref.read(feedServiceProvider).toggleLike(postId, !isCurrentlyLiked);
```

This approach updates the UI immediately and then confirms the change with the API, providing a responsive user experience.

### Visual Feedback

I implemented visual feedback for likes using different icons and colors:

```dart
_buildEngagementStat(
  context,
  icon: post.isLiked ? Icons.favorite : Icons.favorite_border,
  count: post.likesCount,
  color: post.isLiked ? Colors.red : null,
  onTap: () {
    // Toggle like
    ref.read(feedProvider.notifier).toggleLike(post.id);
    
    // Call the onLikeTap callback if provided
    if (onLikeTap != null) {
      onLikeTap!();
    }
  },
),
```

This provides clear visual feedback to the user about the current like state of a post.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Model Updates

Updating the Post model required careful consideration of the existing code to ensure compatibility.

**Solution**: I added the new field with a default value to maintain backward compatibility and updated all relevant methods to handle the new field properly.

### Challenge: Optimistic Updates

Implementing optimistic updates required careful state management to ensure a good user experience even if the API call fails.

**Solution**: I implemented a pattern where the UI is updated immediately, and if the API call fails, the state is reverted to its previous state.

### Challenge: Visual Feedback

Providing clear visual feedback for likes required updating the UI components to handle different states.

**Solution**: I enhanced the engagement stat component to accept a color parameter and display different icons based on the liked state.

## Next Steps

1. **Comment System**: Implement the ability to view and add comments to posts
2. **Share Functionality**: Add the ability to share posts within the app and to external platforms
3. **Infinite Scrolling**: Implement proper pagination for the feed to load more posts as the user scrolls
4. **Animation**: Add animations for like actions to provide more engaging feedback

## Conclusion

The implementation of the like system is a significant step in enhancing the social interactions in ZinApp. It provides users with a way to express appreciation for content and creates a more engaging social experience. The optimistic updates and visual feedback create a responsive and intuitive user experience.
