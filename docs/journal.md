[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Planning execution of Demo Readiness Action Plan.
- **Details:**
    - Received detailed action plan focusing on resolving technical issues (Map crash), ensuring design consistency (Typography, Buttons, Inline Styles), enhancing UI/UX polish (Animations, Component Polish, Empty States), preparing for demo (DEMO_MODE toggle, Loading States), and documentation.
    - Formulated a phased execution strategy incorporating pre/post-documentation for each major step.
- **Decision:** Proceed with executing the action plan, starting with Phase 1 (Address Map Crash).
- **Follow-up:** Begin Phase 1 implementation.

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Planning execution of diagnostic report findings.
- **Details:**
    - Received diagnostic report and detailed action plan to address build issues, cleanup legacy config/dependencies, and ensure demo readiness.
    - Confirmed understanding of the plan, including package removal, cache purging, gitignore updates, base render testing, hygiene fixes (typing, assets), and final documentation.
    - Added pre/post-documentation steps to the execution plan.
- **Decision:** Proceed with executing the cleanup and restoration plan as outlined.
- **Follow-up:** Begin Phase 1: Package, Config & Cache Cleanup.

---

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Executed Phase 1 (Cleanup) & Phase 2 (Base Render Test).
- **Details:**
    - Uninstalled `nativewind`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`.
    - Confirmed `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js` were already deleted.
    - Purged `node_modules`, `.expo`, `.cache`, `package-lock.json`, npm cache.
    - Updated `.gitignore` to include `.cache/`.
    - Reinstalled dependencies via `npm install`.
    - Modified `App.tsx` to perform a static base render test using `twrnc`.
    - Ran `npx expo start --clear --tunnel`.
- **Issues:**
    - Initial base render test passed, confirming `twrnc` works and previous build errors were likely cache/config related.
    - Persistent TS errors related to path aliases (`@types`, `@constants`) and module resolution (`Cannot find module 'react'`) observed after cleanup, despite `tsconfigPaths` and `esModuleInterop` being enabled. Explicitly installed `@types/react`.
- **Decision:** Proceed with Phase 3 (Hygiene Fixes), using path aliases but noting the TS errors need separate investigation if they persist at runtime.
- **Follow-up:** Begin Phase 3: Structure & Hygiene Fixes.

---

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Executed Phase 3 (Hygiene Fixes - Typing & Aliases) & Started Phase 4 (Restore Functionality).
- **Details:**
    - Verified component prop typing (`React.FC<Props>`) in refactored files (`LandingScreen`, `BookingCard`, etc.). No major `any` types found in these specific files.
    - Attempted to restore path aliases (`@types`, `@constants`, etc.) in refactored files.
    - TS errors for path aliases persisted immediately in the IDE.
    - Reverted alias changes back to relative paths in component/screen files as a temporary measure to isolate potential runtime issues. (Correction: Decided to keep aliases and address TS errors later).
    - Corrected `twrnc` import path in `BookingCard.tsx` (was `../../twrnc`, changed to `twrnc`).
    - Verified assets in `assets/images`.
    - Restored original `App.tsx` structure (re-enabled `AuthProvider`, `AppNavigator`) using path aliases.
- **Issues:**
    - Path alias resolution errors persist in TypeScript, even with `tsconfigPaths` and `esModuleInterop` enabled. This seems to be a TS server/config issue, not necessarily a runtime blocker.
- **Decision:** Proceed with runtime testing (Phase 4) using path aliases, acknowledging the TS errors need further investigation if runtime fails.
- **Follow-up:** Test navigation and runtime behavior.

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Planning next steps based on Demo Readiness Action Plan.
- **Details:**
    - Received detailed action plan focusing on resolving technical issues (Map crash), ensuring design consistency (Typography, Buttons, Inline Styles), enhancing UI/UX polish (Animations, Component Polish, Empty States), preparing for demo (DEMO_MODE toggle, Loading States), and documentation.
    - Formulated a phased execution strategy incorporating pre/post-documentation for each major step.
- **Decision:** Proceed with executing the action plan, starting with Phase 1 (Address Map Crash).
- **Follow-up:** Begin Phase 1 implementation.
    - Created core configuration files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `babel.config.js`, `app.json`.
    - Generated mock API data files in `mock-api/db/` (`stylists.json`, `services.json`, `bookings.json`, `users.json`, `ratings.json`, `db.json`).
    - Created placeholder/initial files for constants, types, navigation, API service, auth state, and root `App.tsx`.
    - Installed project dependencies using `npm install`.
- **Issues:**
    - Initial `move` command failed (likely shell mismatch), resolved using `mv`.
    - `npm install` reported vulnerabilities.
- **Decisions:**
    - Proceeded with `mv` for file organization.
    - Used standard Expo/React Native project structure.
    - Populated mock data based on `MOCK_API_SCHEMA.md`.
    - Configured path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js`.
- **Follow-up:**
    - Address npm vulnerabilities.
    - Begin implementing components and screens.
    - Resolve initial TS errors.

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Investigating Hook/Context Errors after React Version Override.
- **Details:**
    - Added `overrides` for `react` and `react-dom` to `18.2.0` in `package.json` to resolve duplicate React versions caused by `moti` -> `framer-motion`.
    - Reinstalled dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).
    - Cleared cache and restarted app (`npx expo start --clear --tunnel`).
- **Issues:**
    - The "Invalid hook call" and "Cannot read property 'useContext' of null" errors persisted, indicating the duplicate React version was not the sole cause or the override was ineffective. Stack trace still implicated Moti/usePresence.
- **Decision:** The next step is to isolate Moti by temporarily removing its usage to see if the hook/context errors resolve.
- **Follow-up:** Document plan (this entry), identify Moti usage, comment it out, and test again.

---

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Isolate Moti to debug Hook/Context errors.
- **Details:**
    - Identified Moti usage in `StylistListScreen`, `LandingScreen`, `BarberProfileScreen`, `BarberCard`.
    - Commented out Moti imports and related animation code (`MotiView`, `MotiImage`) in these files.
    - Cleared cache and restarted app (`npx expo start --clear --tunnel`).
- **Result:** The "Invalid hook call" and "Cannot read property 'useContext' of null" errors **were resolved**. The app now loads without crashing.
- **Conclusion:** The errors were caused by an incompatibility or incorrect integration of Moti (v0.30.0) with the current stack (Expo 52, RN 0.75.3, Reanimated 3.16.1, React Navigation 6.x), specifically interfering with React Hooks/Context.
- **Decision:** Keep Moti commented out for now. Proceed with the Demo Readiness Action Plan, focusing on design consistency first. Revisit animation implementation later, potentially using Reanimated directly or finding a compatible Moti version/alternative.
- **Follow-up:** Update `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. Proceed with Phase 2 (Design Consistency & Visual Identity Implementation) of the action plan.

---

[2025-04-09] Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Action:** Executed Demo Readiness Plan - Phase 1 & 2 (Technical Fixes & Design Consistency).
- **Details:**
    - Documented plan start in journal.
    - Created `ErrorBoundary` component.
    - Wrapped `LiveTrackScreen` in `ErrorBoundary` and replaced `MapTracker` with a placeholder View to prevent potential crashes.
    - Confirmed via search that custom `Typography` and `Button` components are likely used consistently (no stray `<Text>` or `<Button>` found).
    - Refactored remaining inline styles in `LiveTrackScreen` and `App.tsx` (sanity test part) to use `twrnc`.
    - Refactored `StyleSheet` styles in `BarberCard.tsx` to use `constants/spacing`.
    - Fixed `Typography` usage in `BarberCard.tsx` (removed invalid `weight` prop, used correct `variant`).
    - Added `isLoading` prop and shimmer effect to `BarberCard.tsx`.
    - Added empty state handling to `StylistListScreen.tsx`.
    - Corrected import paths in several components to use aliases (though TS errors for aliases persist in IDE).
    - Fixed file corruption in `BarberCard.tsx` caused by previous edit attempt.
- **Issues:**
    - Persistent TS errors related to path alias resolution (`@types`, `@constants`, etc.) remain in multiple files.
- **Decision:** Proceed with remaining phases, keeping path aliases and addressing TS errors later if they cause runtime issues.
- **Follow-up:** Update documentation (`COMPONENT_MAP.md`, final journal entry) and commit current state.
