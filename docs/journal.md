- **Action:** Comprehensive codebase cleanup, DEMO MODE implementation, and UI improvements.
- **Details:**
    - Verified and confirmed `.gitignore` has proper entries for `.expo/` and other runtime folders
    - Confirmed legacy config files (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) were already removed
    - Created a sanity render test in `App.tsx` to verify basic styling and rendering pipeline
    - Added a `DebugScreen.tsx` for isolated testing of the rendering system
    - Performed complete environment cleanup: removed `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, cleared npm cache

    - Animation system not fully implemented
- **Decisions:**
    - Implemented a toggle in `App.tsx` to easily switch between sanity test and full navigation
    - Created a dedicated debug screen for isolated testing
    - Used tunnel mode for remote testing when working out of office

- **Action:** Initial project scaffolding based on documentation review and plan.
- **Details:**
    - Created directory structure: `assets`, `components`, `constants`, `hooks`, `mock-api`, `navigation`, `screens`, `services`, `state`, `theme`, `types`, `utils`.
    - Created core configuration files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `babel.config.js`, `app.json`, `nativewind.config.ts`.
    - Generated mock API data files in `mock-api/db/` (`stylists.json`, `services.json`, `bookings.json`, `users.json`, `ratings.json`, `db.json`).
    - Created placeholder/initial files for constants, types, navigation, API service, auth state, and root `App.tsx`.
    - Installed project dependencies using `npm install`.
- **Issues:**
    - Initial `move` command failed (likely shell mismatch), resolved using `mv`.
    - `npm install` reported 11 vulnerabilities (2 low, 9 high).
- **Decisions:**
    - Proceeded with `mv` for file organization.
    - Used standard Expo/React Native project structure.
    - Populated mock data based on `MOCK_API_SCHEMA.md`.
    - Configured path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js`.
- **Follow-up:**
    - Address npm vulnerabilities (run `npm audit` for details).
    - Begin implementing components and screens as per `TODO.md`.
    - Resolve TypeScript errors reported after initial file creation (likely resolved by `npm install`, but needs verification).
