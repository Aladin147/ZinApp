# ZinApp V2 Testing Strategy

## 1. Goal
   - To ensure ZinApp V2 is reliable, functional, performant, and meets quality standards before release.
   - To catch regressions early in the development cycle.
   - To validate that the application meets business requirements and user expectations.

## 2. Testing Levels & Scope
   We will employ a multi-layered testing approach based on the testing pyramid:

   - **Unit Tests (High Coverage):**
     - **Scope:** Test individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. Focus on business logic within services (e.g., `MockDataService`, `RealApiService` - mocked dependencies), utility functions, state management logic (reducers/notifiers), and data models.
     - **Tools:** `package:test`, `package:mockito` (or `package:mocktail`).
     - **Goal:** Verify correctness of logic components quickly and reliably. Aim for high code coverage in critical logic areas.

   - **Widget Tests (Medium Coverage):**
     - **Scope:** Test individual Flutter widgets in isolation or small groups of widgets. Verify UI rendering, interaction handling (button taps, form inputs), and state changes within widgets.
     - **Tools:** `package:flutter_test`.
     - **Goal:** Ensure UI components render correctly, respond to user input as expected, and reflect state changes accurately. Test variations like different screen sizes or platform themes.

   - **Integration Tests (Selective Coverage):**
     - **Scope:** Test interactions between multiple units or widgets, or test flows that involve asynchronous operations like API calls (using the mocked `ApiService`). Test navigation flows between screens. Test interactions with platform plugins (e.g., secure storage, haptics - mocked).
     - **Tools:** `package:flutter_test`, `package:integration_test`.
     - **Goal:** Verify that different parts of the application work together correctly. Focus on critical user flows (e.g., booking flow, login, rating submission).

   - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Low Coverage - Manual Focus Initially):**
     - **Scope:** Test complete user flows from start to finish on real devices or emulators/simulators, interacting with the application as a real user would.
     - **Tools:** Manual testing initially. Consider `package:patrol` or `Appium` for automation later if needed.
     - **Goal:** Validate the overall user experience and ensure critical paths work correctly in a realistic environment.

   - **Manual / Exploratory Testing (Continuous):**
     - **Scope:** Unscripted testing performed by developers and potentially QA/stakeholders to discover usability issues, edge cases, and unexpected behavior. Testing visual polish, animations, and overall feel. Accessibility testing using screen readers.
     - **Tools:** Human testers, accessibility tools (TalkBack/VoiceOver, Flutter Inspector).
     - **Goal:** Find issues not easily caught by automated tests, assess usability and design implementation.

## 3. Testing Strategy by Feature Area
   - **UI Components:** Primarily Widget Tests.
   - **State Management (Provider/Riverpod):** Unit Tests for logic, Widget Tests for UI integration.
   - **API Services (`ApiService` implementations):** Unit Tests (mocking HTTP clients or JSON files). Integration tests for flows using the `MockApiService`.
   - **Gamification Logic:** Unit Tests for XP/token calculations. Integration tests for flows triggering gamification updates.
   - **Social Engine/FYP:** Unit Tests for logic (if any complex logic exists). Widget tests for feed rendering. Integration tests for posting/liking flows (using mock service).
   - **Authentication:** Unit Tests for token handling logic. Integration tests for login/logout flows.
   - **Navigation:** Widget/Integration Tests to verify routing.
   - **Accessibility:** Manual testing with screen readers, Flutter Inspector checks, automated checks where possible (e.g., contrast via tools).

## 4. Tools & Infrastructure
   - **Test Runner:** `flutter test` (for unit and widget tests), `flutter test integration_test` (for integration tests).
   - **Mocking:** `mockito` or `mocktail`.
   - **Code Coverage:** Generate coverage reports (`flutter test --coverage`). Aim for reasonable coverage targets, especially for critical logic (e.g., >70%).
   - **CI/CD (Future):** Integrate test execution (unit, widget, potentially integration) into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Codemagic) to run tests automatically on commits or PRs.

## 5. Test Data Management
   - Use the mock JSON files (`/lib/mock_data/`) as the primary source for test data in unit, widget, and integration tests using the `MockApiService`.
   - Ensure mock data covers various scenarios (e.g., empty states, different user levels, error conditions).

## 6. Responsibilities
   - **Developers:** Responsible for writing unit and widget tests for their code. Participate in integration testing and manual/exploratory testing. Fix bugs found during testing.
   - **QA/Stakeholders (If Applicable):** Primarily involved in manual/exploratory testing, E2E testing, and acceptance testing.

## 7. Reporting & Tracking
   - Track test results from CI/CD pipeline.
   - Use project management tools (e.g., GitHub Issues) to track bugs found during testing.
   - Regularly review test coverage reports.
