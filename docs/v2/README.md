# ZinApp V2 Development

This directory contains documentation for the V2 development of ZinApp. V2 represents a significant evolution from V1, with major changes planned for brand identity, core logic, user flow, and overall approach.

## Current Status

V2 is in the planning phase. We are awaiting a detailed brief that will guide the development direction.

## Documentation Structure

As the V2 brief becomes available, this documentation will be expanded to include:

- **V2_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Overview of the new architecture and design patterns
- **V2_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md**: Documentation of the new design system and brand identity
- **V2_USER_FLOWS.md**: Description of the new user flows and interactions
- **V2_TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md**: Record of key technical decisions and their rationales
- **V2_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Guide for migrating components and functionality from V1

## Development Approach

The V2 development will follow these principles:

1. **Clean Slate Where Appropriate**: We'll rebuild components from scratch when necessary, rather than trying to adapt V1 components that don't fit the new vision.

2. **Reuse Where Valuable**: We'll identify and preserve well-designed, reusable components from V1.

3. **Improved Architecture**: We'll implement a more modular, maintainable architecture based on lessons learned from V1.

4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: We'll prioritize tools and practices that improve the development workflow.

5. **User-Centered Design**: All technical decisions will be guided by the goal of creating an exceptional user experience.

## Getting Started

Once the V2 brief is available, this section will provide instructions for setting up the development environment and contributing to V2.

## V1 Reference

The final state of V1 is preserved in the `master` branch. Refer to the V1 documentation for understanding the previous implementation.
