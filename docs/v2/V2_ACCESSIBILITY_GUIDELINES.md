# ZinApp V2 Accessibility Guidelines

## 1. Commitment & Standards
   - **Commitment:** ZinApp is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible experience for all users, regardless of ability. Accessibility is a core requirement for V2 development.
   - **Target Standard:** We aim to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA criteria.

## 2. Color & Contrast
   - **Palette Reference:** Adhere strictly to the defined V2 color palette (`docs/v2/V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md`) and font color logic, which were designed with contrast in mind.
   - **Minimum Contrast Ratios:**
     - **Normal Text:** 4.5:1 against the background.
     - **Large Text (18pt/24px normal or 14pt/19px bold):** 3:1 against the background.
     - **Graphics & UI Components (e.g., icons, button borders):** 3:1 against adjacent colors.
   - **Tools:** Use tools like the Flutter DevTools contrast checker, online contrast checkers (e.g., WebAIM), and browser extensions during development and testing.
   - **Colorblindness:** Do not rely solely on color to convey information. Use icons, text labels, patterns, or other visual cues in addition to color (e.g., for error states, success indicators). Test using color blindness simulators.

## 3. Typography & Readability
   - **Font Sizes:** Follow the defined type scale (`docs/v2/V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md`). Ensure body text is sufficiently large (16px default).
   - **Spacing:** Maintain adequate line height (e.g., 1.5x font size for body) and letter spacing for readability.
   - **Font Weights:** Avoid using very light font weights for essential text. Stick to the defined Regular (400), Medium (500), and Bold (700) weights.
   - **Text Resizing:** Ensure the UI reflows correctly and remains usable when users increase the system font size.

## 4. Tap Targets & Interaction
   - **Minimum Size:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, form controls) must have a minimum touch target size of 48x48 density-independent pixels (dp).
   - **Spacing:** Ensure sufficient spacing between touch targets to prevent accidental activation.
   - **Visual Feedback:** Provide clear visual cues for interaction states (focus, hover/press) that meet contrast requirements.

## 5. Semantics & Screen Readers (Flutter `Semantics` Widget)
   - **Labels:** All interactive elements (buttons, icons acting as buttons, links) and meaningful images must have clear, concise labels using `Semantics(label: '...')`. Decorative images should be hidden from screen readers (`Semantics(excludeSemantics: true)`).
   - **Roles:** Use appropriate semantic widgets or properties (`Semantics(button: true, header: true, link: true, etc.)`) to convey the purpose of elements to assistive technologies.
   - **Structure & Grouping:** Use `Semantics` widgets to group related elements logically, improving navigation for screen reader users. Ensure headings (`Semantics(header: true)`) are used correctly to structure content.
   - **Reading Order:** Verify that the reading order perceived by screen readers matches the logical flow of information on the screen. Adjust using `Semantics` properties if necessary.
   - **Dynamic Content:** Ensure that dynamic updates (e.g., loading new content, error messages) are announced by screen readers using `SemanticsService.announce`.

## 6. Focus Management
   - **Logical Order:** Ensure that interactive elements receive focus in a logical sequence when navigating via keyboard (if applicable) or assistive technology.
   - **Visible Focus Indicator:** Use Flutter's default focus indicators or implement custom indicators that are clearly visible and meet contrast requirements. Avoid removing or obscuring focus indicators.
   - **Managing Focus:** Programmatically manage focus where necessary, especially in modals, dialogs, and complex forms, to ensure a smooth navigation experience.

## 7. Motion & Animation
   - **Reduce Motion:** Respect the user's system setting for reduced motion (`MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations`). Provide alternative, simpler transitions or disable non-essential animations when this setting is enabled.
   - **Avoid Distraction:** Ensure animations do not flash excessively (violating seizure guidelines) or prevent users from completing tasks. Keep animations purposeful and relatively short.

## 8. Testing & Validation
   - **Tools:**
     - **Flutter Accessibility Inspector:** Use regularly during development to check semantics, tap target sizes, and contrast.
     - **Platform Screen Readers:** Test thoroughly with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS).
     - **Contrast Checkers:** As mentioned in section 2.
     - **Color Blindness Simulators.**
   - **Manual Checklist:** Develop a checklist based on WCAG AA criteria relevant to mobile apps.
   - **User Testing:** Whenever possible, involve users with disabilities in testing phases to gather real-world feedback.
