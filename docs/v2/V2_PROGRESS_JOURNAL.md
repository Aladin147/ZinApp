# ZinApp V2 Progress Journal

This document tracks the progress, decisions, and challenges encountered during the development of ZinApp V2.

## April 9, 2025: V2 Kickoff

### Goals
- Set up V2-Dev branch
- Create initial documentation structure
- Analyze V2 memo and requirements

### Accomplishments
- Created V2-Dev branch from master
- Set up basic documentation structure
- Received and analyzed V2 memo
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md
  - V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md
  - V2_GAMIFICATION.md
  - V2_COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md
  - V2_PROGRESS_JOURNAL.md

### Key Insights from V2 Memo
- ZinApp is transitioning from an MVP to a flagship product
- Visual quality, polish, structure, and brand alignment need significant improvement
- New brand identity with specific color palette and typography
- Addition of gamification elements (XP, levels, tokens)
- More dynamic, layered UI with depth and visual feedback
- Structured file organization and component architecture

### Decisions
- Maintain V1 codebase in master branch as reference
- Create new V2-Dev branch for all V2 development
- Document all aspects of V2 before beginning implementation
- Follow strict file structure and naming conventions
- Implement design token system for consistent styling

### Next Steps
- Set up project structure according to V2_FILE_STRUCTURE.md
- Create design token system based on V2_BRAND_IDENTITY.md
- Implement foundation components following V2_COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md
- Set up placeholder gamification system as outlined in V2_GAMIFICATION.md

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Estimated: 1 week)
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement design token system
- [ ] Create foundation components:
  - [ ] Button
  - [ ] Card
  - [ ] Typography
  - [ ] Input

### Phase 2: Layout and Navigation (Estimated: 1 week)
- [ ] Implement layout components
- [ ] Set up navigation with transitions
- [ ] Create screen wrappers and templates

### Phase 3: Feature Components (Estimated: 2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement stylist-related components
- [ ] Create booking flow components
- [ ] Build gamification UI components
- [ ] Develop feedback and notification components

### Phase 4: Screen Implementation (Estimated: 3 weeks)
- [ ] Rebuild LandingScreen
- [ ] Implement ServiceSelectScreen
- [ ] Develop StylistListScreen
- [ ] Create BarberProfileScreen
- [ ] Build BookingScreen
- [ ] Implement LiveTrackScreen
- [ ] Develop Bsse7aScreen

### Phase 5: Gamification Integration (Estimated: 2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement XP and level system
- [ ] Create token economy
- [ ] Develop achievements and badges
- [ ] Integrate gamification with user actions

### Phase 6: Polish and Testing (Estimated: 2 weeks)
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Create error handling
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing V1 Logic Reuse with V2 Visual Redesign
**Solution:** Create adapter patterns to bridge V1 logic with V2 UI components, allowing gradual migration.

### Challenge: Implementing Gamification Without Backend
**Solution:** Create a robust mock system with local storage that simulates the full gamification experience.

### Challenge: Ensuring Consistent Visual Language
**Solution:** Implement a strict design token system and component library with thorough documentation.

## Technical Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Apr 9, 2025 | Create V2-Dev branch | Clean separation from V1 | Feature branches, parallel repo |
| Apr 9, 2025 | Document-first approach | Ensure alignment before coding | Code-first with documentation after |
| Apr 9, 2025 | Design token system | Consistent styling across app | Direct styling, CSS-in-JS |

## Open Questions

1. **Font Selection**: Which specific sans-serif font should we use? Urbanist, Nunito, or Inter?
2. **Animation Library**: Should we use React Native Animated, Reanimated, or Lottie for different animation needs?
3. **Gamification Backend**: How will the gamification system integrate with the backend in the future?
4. **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should we use for V2 components and screens?
