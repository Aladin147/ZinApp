feat(architecture): implement three-layer architecture structure

# Core Architecture Components
- Create UI layer for pure Flutter presentation components
- Create Simulation layer for business logic and gamification engine
- Create Data layer for models, repositories, and data sources

# Directory Structure
- Add detailed README files for each layer with:
  - Purpose and responsibilities
  - Structure definition
  - Guidelines for implementation
  - Example code patterns
- Create subdirectories for components, screens, animations, and themes
- Establish folder structure for token economy, gamification, and provider systems
- Set up data models, repositories, sources, and mock data directories

This commit marks the first step in implementing the Experience Transformation Roadmap, establishing the foundational architecture that will separate concerns and improve maintainability.
