# ZinApp UX Feature Flow & Screen Architecture

## üß≠ Overview
This document defines the complete user-facing experience of ZinApp. It outlines each screen in the mobile app, the state logic between them, their visual priority, and any conditional flow or UX variants. This feature flow is architected to simulate a real operational experience using mocked data, while remaining production-ready with minor backend substitutions.

This is a **critical foundation** for:
- UI/UX design and review
- Component mapping and reuse
- Event logging, analytics planning
- Future testing automation

‚û°Ô∏è OR idle into home (for testing cycle)

---

## üß≠ QR Entry Flow (Trust Loop Simulation)

### QR Entry
- Button: Scan QR ‚Üí Opens mock camera
- After 2 sec ‚Üí Redirect to: **BarberProfileScreen** (static barber demo)
- Context flag: `qrSource = true`

### Use Case:
- Printed flyers in salon ‚Üí client scans ‚Üí sees portfolio ‚Üí books
- Stylists share QR link with clients to reduce acquisition friction

## üß† Conditional Logic & Mock Simulation Points

| Screen            | Condition                    | Action                             |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| BookingScreen     | Guest user                   | Show card input                    |
| BookingScreen     | Verified user                | Show "Pay later" toggle            |
| StylistList       | Empty filter result          | Show "No stylists nearby" message  |
| LiveTrack         | Arrival time expired         | Auto-route to Bsse7a               |
| Bsse7a            | Tip skipped                  | Log feedback, proceed silently     |

All screens should be conditionally mockable via a debug toggle in dev mode.

---

## üì¶ Reusable Components (Planned)

- `<AvatarBadge>` ‚Äì with verified, rating overlay
- `<ServiceIconButton>` ‚Äì for hair/beard/braid etc.
- `<StylishCard>` ‚Äì used in list and favorites
- `<MapTracker>` ‚Äì used in live route and ETA
- `<RatingStars>` ‚Äì shared between Bsse7a and profile

---

## üîö Final Notes
- All screens should function offline, loading from local state/mock
- State persistence not required for demo, but navigational memory improves flow
- Focus on realism of transitions, data density, button feedback (Lottie bounce, shadow tap, shimmer loads)

This flow supports high-fidelity walkthroughs in Expo Go or TestFlight, and will scale directly into production builds with real backend integrations.
